Search (Slide 1, 2 and 3)

Search Problem Defined By...
    - Search space 
        - the set of objects among which we search for the solution
    - Goal condition
        - what are the characteristics of the object we want to find in the search space

Search
    - Process of exploration of the search space
    - Efficiency depends on... 
        - the search space and its size
        - method used to traverse the search space
        - condition to test satisfaction of search objective
    - Efficiency can be influenced with certain techniques!

Graphs
    - Search problems can often be represented by graphs
    - Four components
        1) Search space: set of objects where you search for the solution
            - defined indirectly as initial state + operatirs
        2) Initial state: state configuration we start to search from 
        3) Operators: transform one state to another
        4) Goal condition: defines the target state
    - Two types of graph search problems
        1) Path search
            - find a path between states S and T
        2) Configuration search
            - Find a state satisfying goal condition

Comparison of Problem Formulations (slide: 4) 

Search Process - process of exploration of the state space (search space) through successive application of operators from the initial state.
    - Search tree = structure representing the exploration trace
    - Built online during the search process
    - Branches correspond to explored paths, and leaf nodes to the exploration fringe
        - fringe: a path of unexplored nodes
    - Search tree different from graph representation
        - states can repeat in the search tree
    - ex. search algorithm (slide: 11)
    - Search methods - differ in how they explore the space, that is how they choose the node to expand next

Implementation: states vs nodes
    - State - a (representation of) a physical configuration
    - Node - a data strcuture constituing part of a search tree including...
        1) state
        2) parent
        3) action
        4) path-cost g(n)

Properties of search methods
    1) Completeness - does the method find the solution if it exists
    2) Optimality - is the solution returned by the algorithm optimal? Does it give a minimum length path?
    3) Space and time complexity - how much time/memory does it take to find solution
    
Parameters to Measure Complexity
    - b: maximum branching factor (# of applicable operators)
    - d: depth of the optimal solution 
    - m: maximum depth of the state space

Uniformed Search vs Informed Search
    - Uniformed stratgies: use only the information available in the problem definition
        - Breadth-first search (BFS) 
        - Depth-first serach (DFS)
        - Depth-limited searc
        - Iterative deepning algorithm (IDA)
        - Bi-directional search
        - Uniform-cost search
    - Informed strategies use problem-specific knowledge beyond the info avaialable in the problem definition to improve the search performance. 
        - Greedy search
        - A* search
