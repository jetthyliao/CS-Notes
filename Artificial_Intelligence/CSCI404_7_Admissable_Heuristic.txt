Admissable Heuristics
    - If h(n) is admissable, A* using a tree search is optimal 
    - Time & space for A* is exponentials

Weighted A* Search: take an admissable heuritics "inflate" it by multiplying alpha > 1 and then perform A* search as usual 
    - Fewer nodes tend to get expanded, but resulting solution may be suboptimal

What is a Good Admissable Heuristic
    - Heuristic with as small effective branching factor as possible
    - Small effective branching factor = small avg number of successors to expand

Effective Branching Factor: quality of a heuristic is chracterized by the effective branching factor b* - if the total number of nodes generated by A* search for a particular problem is N and the solution depth is d, then b* is the branching factor that a uniform tree of depth d would ahve to have in order to contain N+1 nodes. 
    - N + 1 = 1 + b* + (b*)^2 + ... + (b*)^d

Dominance - if h1 and h2 are both admissable heuristics where h2 is better than h1. Then h2 dominates h1. (expands less nodes)
    - Maximal admissible heuristic: heuristic not dominated by any other admissible heuristic

Creating Admissible Heuristics
    - Relaxed problem: problem w/ fewer restrictions on the action
    - Subproblems: solving part of a problem first
        - Disjoint pattern database
