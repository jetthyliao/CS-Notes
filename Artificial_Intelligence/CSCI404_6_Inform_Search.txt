Informed Search Methods
    - Incorporate additional measures of a potential of a specific state to reach the goal
    - A potential of a state to reach a goal is measued by a HEURISTIC FUNCTION
        - denoted h(n)

Evaluation-Function Driven Search
    - Search strategy = a node evaluation function f(n)
        - defines desirability of a node
        - expand node w/ best evaluation-function value
        - implementation: priority queue w/ nodes in decreasing order of their evaluation function value
    - Uniform cost search: f(n) = g(n) 
        - g(n) = path cost function 

Best-First Search: incorporates a heuristic function, h(n) to eval-func f(n) to guide the search
    - Heuristic: measures potential of state to reach a goal (usually distance) 
    - ex. TSP problem, calculate direct distance and use that to predict best route

Greedy Search: chooses closest city and keep doing that at each city to travel 
    - Complete: No, can go back and forth between two cities
    - Optimal: No
    - Time: O(b^m) - good heuristic could fix this 
    - Space: O(b^m)

A* Search: estimate total cost of path through node n to the goal f(n) = g(n) + h(n) 
    - Complete: Yes
    - Optimal: Yes if admissable
        - admissable = h(n) < h*(n) or g(n) + heuristic
