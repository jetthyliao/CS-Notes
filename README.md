# CS Notes

This is a collection of my notes from various CS courses. 

All notes were written in markdown. Started doing this because I can type faster than I write and being able to add diagrams into my notes made reviewing subjects easier. 

## Courses

Here's a list of all the courses I have notes in and the textbook for that course if you want to read the source material.

Part of my AI notes are not PDF because my documentation powers had not ascended yet. Also some classes were heavy on projects and most of my notes were just heavily commented projects. 

Hopefully someone will find this useful.
