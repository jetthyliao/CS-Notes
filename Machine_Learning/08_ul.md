#Unsupervised Learning

This lectured is focused on clustering methods and how they differ. 

##Hierarchical Clustering

Hierarchical clustering is an approach to clustering that creates a hierarchy of data samples to determine the clusters that each sample belongs to. 









Height = distance between two points 

Useful to see hierarchy of data, and play with k to find an optimal amount of clusters

##Linkage Criteria

- Single
- Complete
- Average
- Ward: distance isn't euclidean, variance of the points if two clusters were merged

##Manifold

Adjacency Matrix: 

Degree Matrix: importance of each point

Laplacian Matrix: q
